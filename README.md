## Unity Learn_Block1

## Player Control - Prototype1

____

As part of the course, I programmed a car that moves from side to side on a floating road. In addition to getting acquainted with the editor and the Unity workflow, he consolidated his knowledge in creating new C# scripts and performing simple programming actions. By calling basic functions, and then declaring and configuring new variables to change the results of these functions.

## Basic Gameplay - Prototype2

---

In this block, I programmed a top-down game, the purpose of which is to throw food to hungry animals that run to the player in a panic. I became more familiar with some of the most important programming and Unity concepts, including if-then statements, random value generation, arrays, collision detection, prefab files, and instantiation. After completing this course, I learned how to program a basic game with the ability to launch projectiles and maneuver the player to keep the game alive.

### Sound and Effects - Prototype3

---

In this module, I have programmed a dynamic endless runner with side scrolling, in which the player needs to jump over oncoming obstacles in time to avoid an accident. When creating this prototype, I consolidated my knowledge in adding music and sound effects. Learned how to create dynamic endless repeating backgrounds that are crucial for any side-scrolling games. He also consolidated his knowledge in the use of particle effects, such as splashes and explosions.

### Gameplay Mechanics - Prototype4

---

In this module, I have programmed an arcade-style sumo battle with the goal of knocking increasingly complex waves of enemies off a floating island, using power-ups to help defeat them. While creating this prototype, I introduced new game mechanics into my projects, which are new rules or systems that make the game more interesting. I will learn how to program a boost that gives the player a temporary advantage. On the other hand, I've learned to program increasingly complex enemy waves that make it harder for the player to survive.

### User Interface - Prototype5

____

В этом модуле я запрограммировал игру для проверки рефлексов игрока, цель которой состоит в том, чтобы нажимать и уничтожать объекты, случайно подбрасываемые в воздух, прежде чем они смогут упасть с экрана. При создании этого прототипа я внедрил пользовательский интерфейс в свои проекты. Я добавил титульный экран с меню выбора сложности, которое будет определять, насколько сложным является игровой процесс, я добавил отображение результатов, которое показывает, сколько очков заработал игрок, и также я добавил экран завершения игры, который позволит игроку перезапустить игру и повторить попытку.
